            <p> 1. I'm Bryson from Atlanta, Ga and I have aspirations of working as a Web 3
            developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. I'm taking this class to tap into my creative side. I also want to see a
            variety of interesting things on a day to day basis while bringing client
            ideas to life.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. My hobbies include working out, traveling, video games and hanging out
            with family and friends.
